"""
LLM-based NLU — this is the actual "AI" version of the Processing Layer,
as opposed to app/nlu.py's regex pattern matching.

The difference that matters:
  - app/nlu.py:      if the sentence doesn't match a written pattern, it fails.
  - app/nlu_llm.py:  the model reads the sentence and figures out the intent
                      even if it has never seen that exact phrasing before.

It works by sending the user's raw sentence to a small language model
running locally on your laptop (via Ollama — free, no API key, no
internet needed after the one-time model download) with instructions to
return structured JSON. The model does the "understanding"; this file
just parses its answer into the same NLUResult shape app/nlu.py uses, so
nothing else in the project (dialog_manager.py, erp_gateway.py) has to
change to use it.

One-time setup on your laptop (not in this sandbox):
  1. Install Ollama:            https://ollama.com  (free, Win/Mac/Linux)
  2. Pull a small free model:   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
     (about 1.3GB, runs fine on a normal laptop CPU, no GPU required)
  3. That's it — Ollama runs a local server automatically at
     http://localhost:11434 whenever it's installed and running.

Switch the project to use this engine by setting an environment variable:
  Windows:    set NLU_ENGINE=llm
  Mac/Linux:  export NLU_ENGINE=llm
before running `python demo.py` or `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.

Given a user's spoken request, output ONLY a JSON object (no other text, no markdown) with:
  "intent": exactly one of {intents}
  "entities": a dict with any of these keys you can confidently extract:
    - item_id (e.g. "P-102") -- only if a clear code was spoken
    - item_name (free text, e.g. "hydraulic valve") -- if the item was named instead of coded
    - employee_id (e.g. "E-001") -- only if a clear code was spoken
    - employee_name (free text, e.g. "Asha Rao") -- if the employee was named instead of coded
    - status: "present" or "absent" for attendance
    - date: attendance date in YYYY-MM-DD when explicitly provided
    - period: one of "today", "this_month", "last_month"
    - delta: integer, positive to add stock, negative to remove stock
    - quantity: positive integer requested on a purchase request

Examples of the kind of phrasing variation you must handle:
"How much attendance do I have" -> {{"intent": "get_attendance_summary", "entities": {{}}}}
"Am I eligible for exams based on attendance" -> {{"intent": "check_exam_eligibility", "entities": {{}}}}
"Show my attendance for this semester" -> {{"intent": "get_attendance_summary", "entities": {{}}}}
"What's the stock on P-205" -> {{"intent": "check_stock", "entities": {{"item_id": "P-205"}}}}
"Check stock on the hydraulic valve" -> {{"intent": "check_stock", "entities": {{"item_name": "hydraulic valve"}}}}
"Which items are low in stock?" -> {{"intent": "get_low_stock_items", "entities": {{}}}}
"Create a purchase request for 24 units of P-102" -> {{"intent": "create_purchase_request", "entities": {{"item_id": "P-102", "quantity": 24}}}}
"Mark attendance for Asha Rao" -> {{"intent": "mark_attendance", "entities": {{"employee_name": "Asha Rao"}}}}
"Update attendance for E-001 to absent" -> {{"intent": "update_attendance", "entities": {{"employee_id": "E-001", "status": "absent"}}}}
"Give me last month's revenue" -> {{"intent": "get_sales_report", "entities": {{"period": "last_month"}}}}
"How much did we spend this month?" -> {{"intent": "get_expense_summary", "entities": {{"period": "this_month"}}}}
"Show me the highest expenses" -> {{"intent": "get_top_expenses", "entities": {{}}}}
"Generate this month's sales report" -> {{"intent": "get_sales_report", "entities": {{"period": "this_month"}}}}
"Take 10 units off P-301" -> {{"intent": "update_stock", "entities": {{"item_id": "P-301", "delta": -10}}}}
